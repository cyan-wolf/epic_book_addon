## TODO
- Make Crafting recipes
- ~New ore (omw)~ Done
- New tomes
-- Ideas:
--- Maybe a blizzard tome that summons a slow moving cloud of particles that deals a bit of damage, weakens and slows the affected entity and gives the freezing fov?
--- A tome that summons a cloud of black particles where the caster is aiming at that blinds and paralizes the entities affected for a while
--- A tome that just makes a charged creeper explosion. That is all.
--- A tome that shoots out a particle laser for damage? Maybe Warden particles?
--- A wind tome that deals damage, gives levitation to the affected entity for 2 seconds and deals a lot of knockback.
- Get the projectiles to work (kinda optional tbh)
- Is an infinite reach sword even possible?
- Custom crafting table
